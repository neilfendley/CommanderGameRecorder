# Finishers
A finisher is a card that changes the amount of damage your board can do significantly after it resolves compared to before it resolved. 
## Combat Damage based finishers
Lets say your board threatens 5 damage currently with 5 1/1 attackers. A craterhoof behemoth (the classic go-wide green wincon) will buff each to a 7/7 with a 12/12 craterhoof, making the damage total now 47. So the single card craterhoof resulted in a 42 damage difference.

This is simplest to analyze for creature damage based decks. In these decks wincons are most simply "overrun effects" effects that massively buff the whole team

Another option in my opinion is mass evasion, with my favorite of all being Odric, Master Tactician. Single target evasion can be a wincon in a voltron style deck, but often mass evasion is required to get your whole team swinging for lethal.

Another fantastic wincon is asymmetrical board wipes. These are often very deck specific which are available, but any deck can run board wipe + mass indestructibe / phase out. This uses two cards to create an asymmetric board wipe. Creative ways to make asymmetrical board wipes are very satisfying wins!

Another strategy that will often turn a nonlethal board state lethal is damage multiplication, especially if "damage cannot be prevented" is added on. Whether these are a wincon or an enhancer (see [[#Enhancers]]) is subjective.

In a very similar vein, multiple combat steps can serve a similar function to damage multipliers. They may even be better for some decks as they often untap creatures as well, which can lead too additional shenanigans.

For the blue black players it can be more difficult. A popular strategy can be mass creation, Mass-animation or mass reanimation for artifacts or lands into creatures. This can lead to creating 10+ creatures that did not exist prior to the turn. Combining mass-animation with an overrun will almost always get the job done!

## Non Combat Damage Based Finishers

### Spellslinger

If you are going to a non-combat style win, different finishers are going to be required. First, I will go over the one nearest and dearest to my heart: Spell slingers. Spell slinger decks often require the ability to "storm" off as a wincon. However, this is _not_ a single card like in other wincons but a collection of 3 different components. 
1. Mana generator - generates a mana on spell cast
2. Draw - Draws a card on spell cast 
3. Damage - Deals a damage on spell cast

Thus, the finishers in these style of decks are often cards that give you access to drawing and deploying multiple of these components in a single turn.  This includes Underworld breach, past in flames, Yawgmoths will, mana geyser and jeska's will. All of these cards give you access to either a ton of cards, or a ton of mana on which to find your missing storm components and storm off. The more of each component you have on the battlefield reduces the chance of the storming off fizzling without a win. 

### Alternate Damage Based Wincons

Some decks rely on triggered or activated abilities dealing damage to win the game. For example, a sacrifice deck using blood artist triggers to ping an opponent out or a go wide deck pinging the table with impact tremors. In these decks, a wincon will often be card that can burst out a significant amount of the target resource: in both examples a mass token generator would suffice. 
### Combo Based Wincons
1. Get your combo
2. Get mana for your combo
3. Deploy your combo
4. Protect your combo 

To make a more resilient combo deck have redundancy of each effect within the combo. E.g. Blood artist and zulaport cutthroat. However it's worth noting the second copies are often "dead cards" if you draw both. This is why tutors are preferred at the higher level. I believe cedh thinking if 2 copies redundancy is good, 3 is excessive. This is no hard rule and up for debate. 

# Enhancers
Often, any one single spell is often not enough to be a wincon by itself decks. Often a "wincon enhancer" is required, which is a card that significantly amplifies the effect of a wincon. In the token generator example, an amplifier could be a doubling season. It is also possible that the wincon enhancer is another wincon itself, i.e. an multiplier and an overrun effect, which synergize extremely well to skyrocket damage if deployed together. 

Building a deck that has enhancers that work with multiple wincons, or multiple wincons that work with the same enhancer will result in much more consistent ability to end the game! 

# Protection
The last piece of wincons is protection. Your wincon will not work if you cannot protect it. Maybe i'm wrong but I think protection = secret OP. If you can, try tosave your protection for when you are attempting to deploy your wincon + enhancer instead of value pieces.
